I am Roslan Saidi, a software engineer hailing from Malaysia. 

As a Software Engineer with expertise in Laravel (PHP) and Phoenix (Elixir) frameworks for API development and Nuxt for frontend development. My speciality lies in building performant and scalable applications, which I have successfully delivered for various projects throughout my career - ranging from small startups to large enterprises.

Apart from my technical skills, I possess extensive experience with AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, and have proficiently deployed and managed complex systems on the cloud. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning Go, and I am thrilled to apply this newfound knowledge to build more robust and efficient software.

I am always on the lookout for new technologies and techniques to keep up with the latest trends in software engineering. My passion lies in creating high-quality and maintainable code that provides real value to the end-users.
