I'm Roslan Saidi, a software engineer based in Malaysia. 

As a Software Engineer with expertise in Laravel (PHP) and Phoenix (Elixir) frameworks for API development, and NuxtJS for frontend, I specialize in building performant and scalable web applications. Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, ranging from small startups to large enterprises, where I have applied my skills to develop custom solutions that meet the unique needs of each business.

In addition to my technical skills, I have extensive experience with AWS, including EC2, S3, and Lambda, and have successfully deployed and managed complex systems on the cloud. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Go, and I'm excited to apply this new knowledge to build more robust and efficient software.

I am constantly learning new technologies and techniques to stay on top of the latest trends in software engineering, and I am passionate about building high-quality, maintainable code that delivers real value to end-users.
